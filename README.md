## Updated Portfolio

üíÅ Need help updating your Portfolio? Check out the [Career Services milestone resources for online presence](https://mycareerspot.org/onlinepresence).

Your updated portfolio should:

1. Display your full name, email, and phone number

2. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile

3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume

4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:

    * Project title

    * Link to the deployed version

    * Link to the GitHub repository

    * Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

### Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
  the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

## Updated GitHub Profile

Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward. 

Your GitHub profile must contain at least the following items:

1. Professional profile picture

   * A photo or an image other than the default Github identicon. (a semi-professional to professional photo or an avatar photo are preferred)

2. Biography

3. Your current location

4. Email address

5. Link to your deployed portfolio

6. At least 2 pinned repositories:

   * Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.

   * Click "Customize your pins"

   * Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

7. Follow a few of your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.

8. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:

   * Title of app
   * Live link to deployed app
   * List of technologies used
   * 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is
   * 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app
   * License (usually MIT)
   * Contact information for you and any collaborators

9. Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits.

### 3. Updated Resume

üíÅ Need help building a resume? Check out the [Career Services milestone resources](https://mycareerspot.org/resume).

Submit a clear, concise, and compelling resume, tailored to the type of job you‚Äôre looking for.

Your resume should include:

* a heading with your name, phone number, professional email address, links to LinkedIn, portfolio and GitHub

* a technical skills section, with all programming languages and technologies listed

* 3 of your strongest projects/homework assignments with brief description, languages used, and URL

### 4. Updated LinkedIn

üíÅ Need help updating your LinkedIn? Check out the [Career Services milestone resources for online presence](https://mycareerspot.org/onlinepresence).

Update your LinkedIn Profile with a strong bio statement, a professional photo, and links to your Github and portfolio.

### ‚≠ê 5. For Job-Seeking Students (BONUS)

If you are a job-seeking student, then getting yourself marked as employer-ready is an important step to take because you'll get:

* added to our employer referral list, where we'll help match you with employers for interviews

* exclusive access to workshops for employer-ready students

* a statistically higher success rate in your job search

So if you're going to be looking for a job at the end of your boot camp, go ahead and submit these updated items to your Career Materials Advisor (formerly Profile Coach) via BootCampSpot.
